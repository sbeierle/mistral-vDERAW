## üìÑ Executive Summary

This analysis describes the targeted weakening of RLHF soft filters and structural bias components in Mistral 7B. The focus is on **lm_head**, **final_norm**, and **decoder downshift modules** (`out_proj`, `mlp.down_proj`). The modification is carried out in a controlled manner without destroying the decoder behavior.

## üîê Security & Ethics

- **All tests** were conducted locally in an isolated environment.
- **No cloud use, no API hooks, no jailbreak use.**
- This project serves exclusively to simulate control and analysis procedures in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLLM bias.
